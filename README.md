# Glimpse Assets

The collection of resources that Glimpse Viewer and the Glimpse Unity Plugin need for runtime tracking, including pre-trained decision trees.

*Note: we recommended to passing `--depth=1` when cloning, considering the size of the models*

After cloning the repository then run `./unpack.sh` to decompress the decision trees.
